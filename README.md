## 🚀 How to Use

1.  **Open WhatsApp Web:** Navigate to `https://web.whatsapp.com` in your preferred web browser.
2.  **Select Target Chat:** Open the specific chat window in WhatsApp Web where you intend to send test messages. Ensure this chat is fully visible and active.
3.  **Run the Script:** Execute the Python script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python whatsapp_spammer.py
    ```
4.  **Follow Prompts:** The script will guide you through entering your three messages, the desired message count, and the delay.
5.  **Focus WhatsApp Window:** After starting the script, you will have a brief grace period (5 seconds) to switch to your browser and ensure the WhatsApp chat window is the **active and focused application**. The script will then begin typing directly into this active window.
6.  **Avoid Interaction:** While the script is running, **do not use your keyboard or mouse**. Any interaction may disrupt the automated typing process and send messages to unintended locations.
